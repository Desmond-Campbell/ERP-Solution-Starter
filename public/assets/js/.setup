  One CLI for webpack must be installed. These are recommended choices, delivered as separate packages:
     - webpack-cli (https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli)
       The original webpack full-featured CLI.
     - webpack-command (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-command)
       A lightweight, opinionated webpack CLI.
    We will use "npm" to install the CLI via "npm install -D".
    Which one do you like to install (webpack-cli/webpack-command):
    webpack-cli
